## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

This is an automation project to automate the DevOPS processes. It's an development environment that is cloud agnostic:
It's uses Github Codespaces to develop and test the code, and then it's deployed to AWS using Docker and Ansible.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to create in order to run the project:

```text
- AWS Account
- Create a virtualenv
- Install the requirements.txt
```

### Installing

You'll need to install the requirements for the project:
docker, docker-compose, python3, pip3, and ansible.

```bash
